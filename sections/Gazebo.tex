\section{Simulation environment}
    We will simulate the behavior of our robot in the Gazebo Classic simulator\footnote{\url{https://classic.gazebosim.org/}}. Gazebo is a 3D simulator for robots. Its biggest advantage is its direct integration with ROS. This means that we can simulate similar behavior to the one expected of the robot in real-world experiments.\\
    We will use the Husky robot model for our simulations. The Husky was chosen as it is one of the robots we may use in the following real-world experiments, and its model was available to us.\\
    As the creation and implementation of the simulation were not the main focus of this thesis, we have used previously created simulation environments. As the basis for our simulations, we used the \texttt{robingas\_mission\_gazebo} project\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ctu-vras/robingas_mission_gazebo}}. This project was created by the CTU CRAS group. We have modified the project to fit our needs.\\
    The simulation project was named \texttt{road\_crossing\_gazebo} and is available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/vlk-jan/road_crossing_gazebo}}.
