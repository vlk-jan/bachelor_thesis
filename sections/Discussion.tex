The challenge of robot navigation in urban environments is a widely acknowledged and extensively studied problem within the field of autonomous robotics. However, the specific problem of autonomous road crossing for robots is more specialized, resulting in a comparatively limited body of research in this domain. In this chapter, we will explore the existing literature and relevant works in the field of road crossing by autonomous agents.\\
